# Overview
When i used [OP Auto Clicker](https://www.opautoclicker.com/) as good as it was,i always thought that app lacks some options, like the ability to hold the mouse buttons for a desired amount of time before releasing it,
so i started making my own auto clicker from scratch based on OP auto clicker but with more options. üêº
with this auto clicker you can easily achieve near 1000cps or the specific cps you desire with your own Hold time, click type , interval and location
like OP auto clicker you may assign a new hotkey which by default is 'F6'.

## Preview 
just like OP Auto Clicker it has a minimalistic interface with not so much distracting styling and buttons just take a look at the demo image

## RoadMap ‚úÖ
 - [ ] Tray icon so it stays on while hidden
 - [ ] Retaining settings when closing the app (a settings.json file probably)
 - [ ] a more efficient click speed to achieve higher than 1000cps speed ( already experimenting with C code)
