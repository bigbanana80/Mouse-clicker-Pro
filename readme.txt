  When i used OP auto clicker i always tho that app lack some options, like the ability to hold the mouse buttons for a desired amount of time before releasing it,
so i started making my own auto clicker based on OP auto clicker but with more options. üêº
with this auto clicker you can easily achive near 1000cps or the specific cps you desire with your own Hold time, click type , interval and location
like OP auto clicker you may assign a new hotkey which by default is 'F6'.
